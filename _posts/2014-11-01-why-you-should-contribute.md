title: Why You Should Contribute
author: Matt Amos
---

OpenStreetMap is a fantastic project to which thousands of people
around the world contribute daily. OpenStreetMap distributes data
which powers services used by millions and helps save lives. Despite
the dedicated efforts of volunteers, we cannot run the project without
computer hardware, which costs money. You can help the project thrive
over the next year by contributing what you can.

## For individuals

If you have contributed data to OpenStreetMap, or time to helping
organise mapping activities: _thank_ _you_ for everything you've
already done!

OpenStreetMap only survives because of the work put in by thousands of
hard-working and selfless volunteer contributors. If you are one of
these people, then you are already doing a great thing for the
project.

If you would like to do more, then you can:

* [Join the Foundation][1] and support the body which supports (but
  doesn't control) the project. By being a part of the Foundation,
  your voice can be heard in discussions about how the Foundation is
  run.

* [Join a Working Group][2] and give your time to solving those issues
  which require greater commitment. Being on a Working Group, as the
  name suggests, is hard work and requires diligence, but can make a
  huge difference to the project.

* Buy a "Hardware drive 2014" t-shirt? Proudly wear your support on
  your (short) sleeve!

* [Donate money][3] to the hardware funding drive. Whatever you can
  spare will be gratefully received and put towards hardware which
  is necessary for the continued growth and success of the project.

## For companies

Whether you use OpenStreetMap data in your products and services, or
are just interested in helping, corporate sponsorship of OpenStreetMap
events and hardware helps the project to keep going and be inclusive.

If your company would like to help the project grow and succeed, then
you can:

* [Join the Foundation][4] as a corporate member. Your support of the
  Foundation will be greatly appreciated and publicly lauded.

* Sponsor a server? You can pick an item from our hardware needs list
  and help us bring a sponsored service to the community. (Sponsored
  banners on services for 12 months? Not on the main page, of
  course...)

* [Donate money][3] to the hardware funding drive. Any contribution
  will help and is gratefully received.
